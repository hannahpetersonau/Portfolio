# Hannah Peterson's Portfolio

I am currently enrolled as a Masters student at American University. I am studying data science with a focus in computer science while enrolled in the American University Honors Program. I hold a cumulative 3.7 GPA and am set to graduate with my Masters of Data Science in May of 2027. I'm currently looking for an internship to expand my skills in the data analysis field.

I have acquired many skills from my education at American, including but not limited to R, Markdown, Python, HTML, and Excel. I have experience working on analyst projects in biostatistics and data mining courses alike. My personal passion is any statistical modeling involving prediction and regression analysis. I have experience working with complex packages such as plotly() and gganimate(), and am proficient in calculating hypothesis tests for a range of data.

I am currently looking for an internship that allows me to grow and accumulate knowledge in this field. I am open for starting an opportunity beginning the summer of 2025.
