# Portfolio
I am currently enrolled as a Masters student at American University. I am studying data science with a focus in computer science while enrolled in the American University Honors Program. I hold a cumulative 3.7 GPA and am set to graduate with my Masters of Data Science in May of 2027. I'm looking for an internship to expand my skills in this field.
